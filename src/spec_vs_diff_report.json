  "summary": "The diff adds a new Bitcoin mining dashboard UI (shell/header/dashboard/settings/payouts) and related React Query hooks, plus mining-themed styling tokens. However, there are gaps around the required generated image assets, payout flow (custom address on request), and remaining heart/Valentine-adjacent wording in the UI footer.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Payout request uses the currently saved payout address by default and allows changing it before submitting.",
      "reason": "The UI lets the user type an optional address, but the payout mutation only submits an amount (no address). This prevents actually requesting a payout to a changed address.",

      "requirement": "Include new custom static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated (hero bg, icon sheet, mining rig illustration) and render them from the frontend; update UI to use new assets.",
      "reason": "The UI references only the hero background image path, but the diff summary does not show the required assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, nor any references to the required icon sheet and mining rig illustration.",

      "requirement": "Remove Valentine/hearts/romantic proposal language and CTAs from the primary app flow.",
      "reason": "The unauthenticated and authenticated shells include a footer line with a heart symbol (\"Built with ❤️\"), which conflicts with the requirement to remove hearts/romance styling/copy from the primary flow.",
