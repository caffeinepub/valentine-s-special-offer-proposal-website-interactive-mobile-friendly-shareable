  "summary": "The diff implements most of the new Taskora Global reward-platform UI (Dashboard/Earn/VIP/Transfers/Admin) plus a new Tailwind theme, updated branding/meta, and React Query hooks. However, several key requirements are either not evidenced in the diff (notably the generated image assets), or appear to still rely on legacy/exchange backend state/methods rather than fully implementing the new backend data models and lifecycle semantics (e.g., transfer history/statuses and recent activity).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-47",
      "requirement": "Dashboard shows a summary of today/this week earnings from ads/tasks (in addition to balance, VIP tier, recent activity).",
      "reason": "The added DashboardPage shows Available Balance, VIP Status, and Total Earnings (all-time), but no visible today/this week earnings summary in the provided diff snippet.",

      "requirement": "Backend canister adds persistent reward-platform models and methods (account summary, earning items/claims lifecycle, VIP requests lifecycle, USDT addresses, deposit/withdraw request + completion, transfer history) with consistent access control and clear Unauthorized traps.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo shows new types and some state maps, but the frontend hooks still call legacy exchange methods/state (e.g., getExchangeStateShared) for deposits/withdrawals and activity aggregation, indicating the new backend transfer/history surface may not be implemented or wired end-to-end in the diff. The diff snippet does not provide evidence of the full set of required backend methods and admin processing actions.",

      "reason": "UI references generated asset paths (e.g., /assets/generated/taskora-logo.dim_512x512.png and taskora-hero...), but the diff summary does not show any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
